<h1>Method</h1>
    <p><h4>1. Brown the beef, then cook the onions:</h4></p>
    <p>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat. Add the shank slice or stew beef. Let the beef brown lightly on one side, then turn over.</p>
    <p>Add the chopped onions to the pot. Let the onions cook and soften, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h4><p>2. Add 4 cups broth and simmer until the beef is tender:</p></h4>
<p>Pour 4 cups of the beef broth over the beef and onions in the pot. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until the meat is falling-off-the-bone tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.</p>

<h4><p>3. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.</p></h4>
<h4><p>4. Meanwhile, prep and roast the root vegetables:</p></h4>
<p>Peel and chop the beets, carrots, and potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Toss the beets and carrots with a teaspoon or two of olive oil and spread them out in a single layer on a foil lined roasting pan. Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Toss the potatoes with olive oil and make room for them in the roasting pan, and roast everything an additional 15 minutes.</p>

<h4><p>5. Remove the meat from the pot:</p></h4>
<p>Once the beef has cooked through until tender, remove from the pot, and take the pot off the heat. If you are using a beef shank, remove and discard any bone, connective tissue, and excess fat. Chop the meat into bite sized pieces.</p>

<h4><p>6. Skim the soup:</p></h4>
<p>Skim off any excess fat from the liquid in the pot.</p>

<h4><p>7. Finish cooking the soup:</p></h4>
<p>Return the pot to the stove and add the remaining broth, the carrots, beets, and potato. Add the chopped meat to the pot, the sliced cabbage, and a half cup of the fresh dill. Bring to a simmer, and cook for another 15 minutes or so, until the cabbage is cooked through.</p>

<p>Add the vinegar and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. (I use about 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper, but the amount you use will depend on how salty your beef broth is to begin with.)</p>
<p>The soup is best made a day ahead. (The longer the soup sits, the more it will all turn the deep red color of beets.)</p>
<p>Serve ladled into bowls with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of fresh dill.</p>
